UME - Ultimate Media Extension - PATCH LOG v2.3
================================================================================

RELEASE DATE: December 2024
SEVERITY: MAJOR USABILITY ENHANCEMENT

================================================================================
ISSUE FIXED
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Keyboard shortcuts not working in fullscreen mode
- Speed control shortcuts (S/D, Z/X, R, G, V) completely broken in fullscreen
- Users forced to exit fullscreen to change video speed
- Affected all major video sites (YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, etc.)
- Created frustrating interruptions during video watching experience

ROOT CAUSE: Document-only keyboard event listeners
- Events only attached to document level
- Fullscreen mode changes focus context and event propagation
- Video players capture keyboard events before reaching document listeners
- No fallback mechanism for fullscreen scenarios

================================================================================
SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED
================================================================================

ENHANCED KEYBOARD EVENT HANDLING SYSTEM
   ✅ Dual event listeners (document + video elements)
   ✅ Fullscreen state change detection (all browser prefixes)
   ✅ Automatic focus management for fullscreen elements
   ✅ Enhanced event prevention (preventDefault/stopPropagation)
   ✅ Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge)
   ✅ Video element focus capability with tabindex="-1"
   ✅ Proper cleanup of video-level event listeners
