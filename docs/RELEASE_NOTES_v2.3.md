# UME - Ultimate Media Extension v2.3 Release Notes

## üöÄ Release Highlights

Version 2.3 focuses on a critical usability improvement that enhances the fullscreen video watching experience by fixing keyboard shortcuts that were completely broken in fullscreen mode.

## üéÆ Major Enhancement: Fullscreen Keyboard Shortcuts

### The Problem
Users reported that when videos entered fullscreen mode (especially on YouTube, Netflix, Vimeo, etc.), **all keyboard shortcuts for speed control would completely stop working**. This included:
- **S/D** - Slower/Faster playback speed
- **Z/X** - Rewind/Advance 10 seconds  
- **R** - Reset speed to 1.0x
- **G** - Toggle preferred speed
- **V** - Show/hide controller

Users were **forced to exit fullscreen** every time they wanted to change video speed, creating a frustrating interruption to their viewing experience.

### The Root Cause
The keyboard event system had a fundamental architectural flaw:
- **Document-only listeners**: Keyboard events were only attached to the document level
- **Focus context changes**: When videos entered fullscreen, the focus context shifted to the fullscreen video element
- **Event capture**: Video players would capture and consume keyboard events before they could reach our document listeners
- **No fallback mechanism**: There was no alternative event listening system for fullscreen scenarios

### The Solution
We implemented a comprehensive fix that makes keyboard shortcuts work seamlessly in fullscreen mode:

#### üéØ **Dual Event Listener Architecture**
- **Document-level listeners**: Maintained for general page interaction
- **Video-level listeners**: Added keyboard listeners directly to each video element
- **Redundant coverage**: Ensures shortcuts work regardless of focus context

#### üñ•Ô∏è **Comprehensive Fullscreen Detection**
- **Cross-browser support**: Handles all fullscreen API prefixes:
  - Standard: `fullscreenchange`
  - WebKit: `webkitfullscreenchange` 
  - Mozilla: `mozfullscreenchange`
  - Microsoft: `MSFullscreenChange`
- **State tracking**: Monitors fullscreen entry/exit with detailed logging
- **Focus management**: Automatically ensures video elements can receive keyboard events

#### ‚ö° **Enhanced Event Handling**
- **Consistent prevention**: Always prevent default and stop propagation for our shortcuts
- **Conflict resolution**: Prevents native player controls from interfering
- **Focus capability**: Added `tabindex="-1"` to make video elements focusable
- **Proper cleanup**: Enhanced removal of video-level event listeners
